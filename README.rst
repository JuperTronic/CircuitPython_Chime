A CircuitPython class for generating wind chime and bell sounds using `synthio`.

The CedarGrove CircuitPython Chime class provides `synthio` note overtones and envelopes developed from
a combination of tubular chime algorithms and empirical models. Three chime voices are included
in the class (``Voice.Tubular``, ``Voice.Bell``, and ``Voice.Perfect``) as well as selectable chime
and striker materials. The ``Scales`` class contains a library of common wind chime and bell scales
in a collection of Scientific Pitch Notation (SPN) lists.

The ``Chime`` class is instantiated after an MCU board-specific audio output object is defined. The
audio output object can be an Analog DAC or PWM GPIO pin as well as an I2S DAC output (as in the
simpletest example). Chime notes are then played by the ``Chime.strike(root_note, amplitude)`` function.


Dependencies
------------
This class depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_
* `CedarGrove CircuitPython_MIDI_Tools <https://github.com/CedarGroveStudios/CircuitPython_MIDI_Tools>`_

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading
`the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://circuitpython.org/libraries>`_
or individual libraries can be installed using
`circup <https://github.com/adafruit/circup>`_.

Usage Example
-------------

.. code-block:: python

    import time
    import board
    import random
    import audiobusio
    import audiomixer
    from cedargrove_chime import Chime, Scale, Voice, Material, Striker

    # Instantiate I2S output and mixer buffer for synthesizer
    audio_output = audiobusio.I2SOut(
        bit_clock=board.D12, word_select=board.D9, data=board.D6
    )
    mixer = audiomixer.Mixer(
        sample_rate=11020, buffer_size=4096, voice_count=1, channel_count=1
    )
    audio_output.play(mixer)
    mixer.voice[0].level = 1.0

    # Instantiate the chime synth with mostly default parameters
    chime = Chime(mixer.voice[0], scale=Scale.HarryDavidPear)

    # Play scale notes sequentially
    for index, note in enumerate(chime.scale):
        chime.strike(note, 1)
        time.sleep(0.4)
    time.sleep(1)

    while True:
        # Play randomly
        for count in range(random.randrange(10)):
            chime.strike(random.choice(chime.scale), 1)
            time.sleep(random.randrange(1, 3) * 0.6)

        time.sleep(random.randrange(1, 10) * 0.5)

Planned Updates
---------------
* Provide additional chime scales.
* Update the Overtones class to include aluminum, wood, and brass.
* Add link to the '`Windless IoT Garden Chime`' project.
